The Argentine Republic recalls that the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands are an integral part of Argentine national territory and are illegally occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, being the object of a dispute over sovereignty between that country and Argentina that is recognized by various international organizations.The illegal occupation by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has led to the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the following resolutions: 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, concerning the question of the Malvinas Islands, all of which recognize the existence of a dispute over sovereignty and urge theGovernments of the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume negotiations in order to find a just, peaceful and definitive solution to that dispute at the earliest possible opportunity.Furthermore, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization has repeatedly affirmed this position, most recently in the resolution that was adopted on 12 June 2008.
