"The Hungarian People's Republic considers it necessary to draw attention to the discriminatory nature of articles 48 and 50 of the Convention, under the terms of which a number of States were precluded from signing and are precluded from acceding to the Convention. The Convention deals with matters which affect the interests of all States and therefore, in accordance with the principle of sovereign equality of States, no State should be barred from participation in a Convention of this nature.""The reservation made by the Government of Bahrain to article 27, paragraph 3, of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations is contrary to the principle of the inviolability of the diplomatic bag which is generally recognized in the international practice, and is incompatible with the objectives of the Convention."Therefore, the Hungarian People's Republic does not recognize this reservation as valid.""The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic does not recognize the validity of the reservation made by the Chinese People's Republic to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of article 37 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."

japan
Declaration with regard to article 34 (a) of the said Convention:"It is understood that the taxes referred to in article 34 (a) include those collected by special collectors under the laws and regulations of Japan provided that they are normally incorporated in the price of goods or services. For example, in the case of the travelling tax, railway, shipping and airline companies are made special collectors of the tax by the Travelling Tax Law. Passengers of railroad trains, vessels and airplanes who are legally liable to pay the tax for their travels within Japan are required to purchase travel tickets normally at a price incorporating the tax with out being specifically informed of its amount. Accordingly, taxes collected by special collectors such as the travelling tax have to be considered as the indirect taxes normally incorporated in the price of goods or services referred to in article 34 (a).""With respect to paragraphs 3 and 4 of article 27 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961, the Government of Japan believes that the protection of diplomatic correspondence by means of diplomatic bags constitutes an important element of the Convention, and any reservation intended to allow a receiving State to open diplomatic bags without the consent of the sending State is incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention.
