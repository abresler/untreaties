"The signature, acceptance or ratification of this Protocol by the Republic of Turkey shall in no way imply the recognition of the `Republic of Cyprus' by Turkey. Nor should it imply any change in Turkey's well-known position that the Greek Cypriot side does not possess the right or authority to become party to international instruments on behalf of Cyprus as a whole. Turkey's accession to this Protocol, therefore, should not signify any obligation on the part of Turkey to enter into any dealings with `Republic of Cyprus' as are regulated by the Protocol."
