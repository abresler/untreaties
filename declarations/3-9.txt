In accordance with the principle of the sovereign equality of States, the People's Republic of Bulgaria considers that in case of difference on specifying the size of the special mission, this question should be settled by agreement between the sending State and the receiving State.The People's Republic of Bulgaria does not accept the provision of article 25, paragraph 1 of the Convention, according to which the agents of the receiving State may enter the premises where the special mission is established in case of fire or other disaster without the express consent of the head of the special mission or, where appropriate, of the head of the permanent mission.The People's Republic of Bulgaria considers it necessary to underline that article 50 of the Convention, which precludes a number of States from becoming parties to it, is of an unjustifiably restrictive character. This provision is incompatible with the very nature of the Convention, which is of a universal character and should be open for accession by all States.

The Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba enters an express reservation with regard to the third sentence of paragraph 1 of article 25 of the Convention, and consequently does not accept the assumption of consent to enter the premises of the special mission for any of the reasons mentioned in that paragraph or for any other reasons.The Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba considers the provisions of articles 50 and 52 of the Convention to be discriminatory in nature because, whereas the Convention deals with matters affecting the interests of all States, the said provisions deny a number of States the right to sign and accede to the Convention, a situation which is contrary to the principle of the sovereign equality of States.
