In accordance with article 55, paragraph 5, of the Agreement, the Italian Government reserves for itself and its political subdivisions the right to exclude from the tax exemption for remuneration employees who are Italian nationals and aliens who are permanently resident in Italy.The Italian Government hereby declares that the immunities provided for by the Agreement shall be conditional on the requirements of maintaining public order and national security.(With regard to the above-mentioned declaration, the Secretary-General received from the Government of Italy the following clarification which has been duly acknowledged by the Bank:"This declaration does not exclude the immunities provided for in the Agreement establishing the Caribbean Development Bank. It is only intended as a safeguard instrument in respect of Bank representatives, recognizing the Italian Government's authority and power to take exceptional measures in case of extraordinary circumstances regarding public order and national security. In those circumstances, the Government of Italy would give treatment to the Bank's representatives no less favourable than what is accorded by Italy to representatives of any other Member of the Bank as contemplated by article 54 (B) and (C) of the agreement establishing the Bank. Therefore, this declaration is not a reservation. The possibility that this declaration will ever have practical relevance is indeed very remote. In fact, it will be applicable only when extraordinary events occur during the stay in Italy of representatives of the Bank who are not citizens or nationals of Italy."
