"1.For the purposes of the Code of Conduct, the term "national shipping line" may, in the case of a State member of the European Economic Community, include any vessel-operating shipping line established on the territory of that member State, in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.2.(a)Without prejudice to paragraph (b) of this reservation, Article 2 of the Code of Conduct shall not be applied in conference trades between States members of the Community and, on a reciprocal basis, between these States and other OECD countries which are parties to the Code;(b)Point (a) shall not affect the opportunities for participation as third country shipping lines in such trades, in accord- ance with the principles reflected in Article 2 of the Code, of the shipping lines of a developing country which are recognized as national shipping lines under the Code and which are:(i)Already members of a conference serving these trades; or(ii)Admitted to such a conference under Article 1 (3) of the Code.3.Article 3 and 14 (9) of the Code of Conduct shall not be applied in conference trades between the States members of the Community and, on a reciprocal basis, between these States and other OECD countries which are parties to the Code.4.In trades to which Article 3 of the Code of Conduct applies, the last sentence of that Article is interpreted as meaning that:(a)The two groups of national shipping lines will co-ordinate their positions before voting on matters concerning the trade between their two countries;(b)This sentence applies solely to matters which the conference agreement identifies as requiring the assent of both groups of national shipping lines concerned, and not to all matters covered bythe conference agreement."The Government of Denmark considers that the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences affords the shipping lines of develing countries extended opportunities to participate in the conference system and is drafted so as to regulate conferences and their activities in open trades (i.e., when opportunities to compete exist). This Government also considers that it is essential for the functioning of the Code and conferences subject thereto that opportunities for fair competition on a commercial basis by non-conference shipping lines continue to exist and that shippers are not denied an option in the choice between conference shipping lines and non-conference shipping lines, subject to loyalty arrangements where they exist. These basic concepts are reflected in a number of provisions of the Code itself, including its objectives and principles, and they are expressly set out in Resolution No. 2 on non-conference shipping lines adopted by the United Nations Conference of Plenipotentiaries.This Government considers furthermore that any regulations or other measures adopted by a contracting party to the United Nations Convention with the aim or effect of eliminating such opportunities for competition by non-conference shipping lines would be inconsistent with the above-mentioned basic concepts and would bring about a radical change in the circumstances in which conferences subject to the Code are envisaged as operating. Nothing in the Convention obliges other contracting parties to accept either the validity of such regulations or measures, or situations where conferences, by virtue of such regulations or measures, acquire effective monopoly in trades subject to the Code.The Government of Denmark declares that it will implement the Convention in accordance with the basic concepts and considerations herein stated and, in so doing, is not precluded by the Convention from taking appropriate steps in the event that another contracting party adopts measures or practices that prevent fair competition on a commercial basis in its liner trades.

Declarations:1.The Government of Portugal considers that the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences affords the shipping lines of developing countries extended opportunitieso participate in the conference system and is drafted so as to regulate conferences and their activities in open trades. The Government also considers that it is essential for the functioning of the Code and conferences subject thereto that opportunities for fair competition on a commercial basis by non-conference shipping lines continue to exist and that shippers are not denied an option in the choice between conference shipping lines and non-conference shipping lines, subject to loyalty arrangements where they exist.

#Spain
For the purposes of implementing the Code of Conduct, the concept of a "national shipping line" may, in the case of a State member of the European Economic Community, include any vessel-operating shipping line established in the territory of that State, in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.(a)Without prejudice to the text of (b) below, article 2 of the Code of Conduct shall not apply in conference trades between States members of the Community and, on the basis of reciprocity, between these States and other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries which are parties to the Code.(b)The text of (a) above shall not affect the opportunities for participation in such trades, as third-country shipping lines, in accordance with the principles set out in article 2 of the Code, by the shipping lines of a developing country which are recognized as national shipping lines under the Code and which are:(I)Members of a conference which ensures such trades, or(II)Admitted to membership of that conference under article 1, paragraph 3, of the Code.Article 3 and article 14, paragraph 9, of the Code shall not apply in conference trades between States members of the Community and, on the basis of reciprocity, between these States and other OECD countries which are parties to the Code.In trades to which article 3 of the Code applies, the final sentence of that article shall be interpreted as follows:(a)The two groups of national shipping lines shall coordinate their positions prior to voting on issues relating to trade between their two countries.(b)This sentence shall apply solely to issues which, under the conference agreement, require the consent of the two groups of national shipping lines concerned, and not to all issues dealt with in the conference agreement.A. The Government of Spain considers that the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences provides the shipping lines of developing countries with ample opportunities to participate in the liner conference system, and that it has been drafted in such a manner as to regulate conferences and their activities within a system of free trade (where there are opportunities for non-conference shipping lines).This Government also deems it essential to the functioning of the Code and of the conferences whose regulation is referred to that there should continue to be opportunities for fair competition on a commercial basis for non-conference shipping lines, and that shippers should not be denied an option in the choice between conference shipping lines and non-conference shipping lines, subject to any loyalty arrangements where they exist. These basic concepts are reflected in several provisions of the Code itself, including its objectives and principles, and are expressly set out in resolution No. 2, concerning non-conference shipping lines, adopted by the United Nations Conference of Plenipotentiaries.B. This Government further believes that any regulation or other measures adopted by a Contracting Party to the United Nations Convention and having the purpose or effect of eliminating such opportunities for competition for non-conference shipping lines would be incompatible with the basic concepts mentioned above, and would effect a radical change in the circumstances under which conferences subject to the Code are envisaged as operative. Nothing in the Convention requires other Contracting Parties to accept either the validity of such regulations, or measures or situations whereby conferences, through such regulations or measures, would, in practice, acquire a monopoly on trades subject to the Code.C. The Government of Spain declares that it will implement the Convention in accordance with the basic concepts and conns stipulatein and that, accordingly, the Convention shall not prevent it from taking appropriate steps in the event that another Contracting Party adopts measures or practices which impede fair competition on a commercial basis in liner shipping service.
