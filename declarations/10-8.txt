The Government of the Republic of Cuba considers that, although the Agreement deals with matters affecting the interests of all States, the provisions of article 3, section 1, are discriminatory in nature since they deprive a number of States of the right to sign and accede to the Agreement, contrary to the principle of universality.The Government of the Republic of Cuba wishes to make an express reservation to article 11, section 2, of the Agreement, since it feels that any disputes arising between States, or between States and the Fund, concerning the interpretation or application of the Agreement should be resolved through direct negotiations by diplomatic means.
