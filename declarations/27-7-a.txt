The ratification does not, therefore, apply to the Territories of the French Republic to which the Treaty establishing the European Community is not applicable.Nonetheless, in accordance with article 4, paragraph 6, of the Protocol, the French Republic shall, in the event of failure to achieve the total combined level of emission reductions, remain individually responsible for its own level of emissions.
